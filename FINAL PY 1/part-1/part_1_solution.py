# Step 2 - Strings


book_name = "The Eye of the World"
author = "Robert Jordan"
# book_name = "Dune"
# author = "Frank Herbert"




sentence1 = "I have read " + book_name + " which is written by " + author + "."
# sentence1 = book_name + " is written by " + author + "."
sentence2 = f"I really enjoyed reading {book_name} by the author {author}!"
# sentence2 = f"Author, {author}, wrote the book {book_name}."


# Step 4 - Integers
# Now let's practice Integers. Replace the "None" below with the publication date of your book.
publication_year = 1990
# publication_year = 1965


# Step 5 - Floats
# Now estimate what the retail value of your book would be at a store and replace the "None" below with a float value of the price. (Doesn't have to be accurate.)
book_price = 21.99
# book_price = 17.99


# Step 6 - Booleans
# Now we will practice with booleans. Replace the "is_awesome" variable with a boolean. True if your book is awesome, False if your book is not awesome.
is_awesome = True
# is_awesome = True
